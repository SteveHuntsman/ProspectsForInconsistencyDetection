# ProspectsForInconsistencyDetection
Scripts and data supporting "Prospects for inconsistency detection using large language models and sheaves" at https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16713

* consistency20240119.py is the script for getting data from ChatGPT
* consistencyDataScript.m is for post-processing and plotting in MATLAB after printing to the Python standard output, copypasting, and minimal find-replacing on prettyprinted numerical data to use as MATLAB input
* Data from 20240122 (various JSON files and a Python pickle) is for the main experiment
* Data from 20230123 (various JSON files and a Python pickle) is for the example with three claim pairs (this example is trivially adapted from the main experiment with a few edits and does not merit scripts of its own)
