# ProspectsForInconsistencyDetection
Scripts and data supporting "Prospects for inconsistency detection using large language models and sheaves."

* consistency20240119.py is the script for getting data from ChatGPT
* consistencyDataScript.m is for post-processing in MATLAB after printing to the Python standard output, copypasting, and minimal find-replacing of numerical data
* Data from 20240122 (various JSON files and a Python pickle) is for the main experiment
* Data from 20230123 (various JSON files and a Python pickle) is for the example with three claim pairs (this example is trivially adapted from the main experiment with a few edits and does not merit scripts of its own)
